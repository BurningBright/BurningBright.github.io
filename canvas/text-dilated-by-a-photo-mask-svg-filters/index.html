  <text y="22">
    Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this 
      </text><text y="50">
    continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the </text><text y="80">proposition that all men are created equal.
 Now we are engaged in </text><text y="110">a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so </text><text y="140">conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a </text><text y="170">great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion </text><text y="200">of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their</text><text y="230">  lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper</text><text y="260"> that we should do this.

 But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate,  </text><text y="290"> we can not consecrate, we can not hallow, this ground. The brave </text><text y="320">men, living  and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far </text><text y="350">above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, </text><text y="380">nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what </text><text y="410">they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to </text><text y="440">the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so </text><text y="470">nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great </text><text y="500">task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take  </text><text y="530">increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full </text><text y="560">measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead</text><text y="590"> shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall </text><text y="620">have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people,</text><text y="650"> by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</text>
