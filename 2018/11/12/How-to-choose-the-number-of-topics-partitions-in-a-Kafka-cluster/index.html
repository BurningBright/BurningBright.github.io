        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.5.1/katex.min.css"><p>This is a common question asked by many Kafka users.<br>The goal of this post is to explain a few important determining factors and provide a few simple formulas.</p>
<h2 id="More-Partitions-Lead-to-Higher-Throughput"><a href="#More-Partitions-Lead-to-Higher-Throughput" class="headerlink" title="More Partitions Lead to Higher Throughput"></a>More Partitions Lead to Higher Throughput</h2><p>The first thing to understand is that <strong>a topic partition is the unit of parallelism in Kafka</strong>.<br>On both the producer and the broker side, writes to different partitions can be done fully in parallel.<br>So expensive operations such as compression can utilize more hardware resources.<br>On the consumer side, Kafka always gives a single partitionâ€™s data to one consumer thread.<br>Thus, the degree of parallelism in the consumer (within a consumer group) is bounded by the number of partitions being consumed.<br>Therefore, in general, <strong>the more partitions</strong> there are in a Kafka cluster, <strong>the higher the throughput</strong> one can achieve.</p>
<p>A rough formula for picking the number of partitions is based on throughput.<br>You measure the throughout that you can achieve on a single partition for production (call it p) and consumption (call it c).<br>Letâ€™s say your target throughput is t.<br>Then you need to have at least max(t/p, t/c) partitions.<br>The per-partition throughput that one can achieve on the producer depends on configurations such as the batching size, compression codec, type of acknowledgement, replication factor, etc.<br>However, in general, <strong>one can produce at 10s of MB/sec on just a single partition</strong> as shown in this benchmark.<br>The consumer throughput is often application dependent since it corresponds to how fast <strong>the consumer logic can process each message</strong>.<br>So, you really need to measure it.</p>
<p>Although itâ€™s possible to increase the number of partitions over time, one has to be careful if messages are produced with keys.<br>When publishing a keyed message, Kafka deterministically maps the message to a partition based on the hash of the key.<br>This provides a guarantee that <strong>messages with the same key are always routed to the same partition</strong>.<br>This guarantee can be important for certain applications since messages within a partition are always delivered in order to the consumer.<br>If the number of partitions changes, such a guarantee may no longer hold.<br>To avoid this situation, a common practice is to over-partition a bit.<br><strong>Basically, you determine the number of partitions based on a future target throughput, say for one or two years later.</strong><br>Initially, you can just have a small Kafka cluster based on your current throughput.<br>Over time, you can add more brokers to the cluster and proportionally move a subset of the existing partitions to the new brokers (which can be done online).<br>This way, you can keep up with the throughput growth without breaking the semantics in the application when keys are used.</p>
<p>In addition to throughput, there are a few other factors that are worth considering when choosing the number of partitions.<br>As you will see, in some cases, having too many partitions may also have negative impact.</p>
<h2 id="More-Partitions-Requires-More-Open-File-Handles"><a href="#More-Partitions-Requires-More-Open-File-Handles" class="headerlink" title="More Partitions Requires More Open File Handles"></a>More Partitions Requires More Open File Handles</h2><p>Each partition maps to a directory in the file system in the broker.<br>Within that log directory, there will be two files (one for the index and another for the actual data) per log segment.<br>Currently, in Kafka, each broker opens a file handle of both the index and the data file of every log segment.<br>So, the more partitions, the higher that one needs to configure the open file handle limit in the underlying operating system.<br>This is mostly just a configuration issue.<br>We have seen production Kafka clusters running with more than 30 thousand open file handles per broker.</p>
<h2 id="More-Partitions-May-Increase-Unavailability"><a href="#More-Partitions-May-Increase-Unavailability" class="headerlink" title="More Partitions May Increase Unavailability"></a>More Partitions May Increase Unavailability</h2><p>Kafka supports intra-cluster replication, which provides higher availability and durability.<br><strong>A partition can have multiple replicas</strong>, each stored on a different broker.<br>One of the replicas is designated as the leader and the rest of the replicas are followers.<br>Internally, Kafka manages all those replicas automatically and makes sure that they are kept in sync.<br>Both the producer and the consumer requests to a partition are served on the leader replica.<br>When a broker fails, partitions with a leader on that broker become temporarily unavailable.<br>Kafka will automatically move the leader of those unavailable partitions to some other replicas to continue serving the client requests.<br>This process is done by one of the Kafka brokers designated as the controller.<br>It involves reading and writing some metadata for each affected partition in ZooKeeper.<br>Currently, operations to ZooKeeper are done serially in the controller.</p>
<p>In the common case when a broker is shut down cleanly, the controller will proactively move the leaders off the shutting down broker one at a time.<br>The moving of a single leader takes only a few milliseconds.<br>So, from the clients perspective, there is only a small window of unavailability during a clean broker shutdown.</p>
<p>However, when a broker is shut down uncleanly (e.g., kill -9), the observed unavailability could be proportional to the number of partitions.<br>Suppose that a broker has a total of 2000 partitions, each with 2 replicas.<br>Roughly, this broker will be the leader for about 1000 partitions.<br>When this broker fails uncleanly, all those 1000 partitions become unavailable at exactly the same time.<br>Suppose that it takes 5 ms to elect a new leader for a single partition.<br>It will take up to 5 seconds to elect the new leader for all 1000 partitions.<br>So, for some partitions, their observed unavailability can be 5 seconds plus the time taken to detect the failure.</p>
<p>If one is unlucky, the failed broker may be the controller.<br>In this case, the process of electing the new leaders wonâ€™t start until the controller fails over to a new broker.<br>The controller failover happens automatically, but requires the new controller to read some metadata for every partition from ZooKeeper during initialization.<br>For example, if there are 10,000 partitions in the Kafka cluster and initializing the metadata from ZooKeeper takes 2 ms per partition, this can add 20 more seconds to the unavailability window.</p>
<p>In general, unclean failures are rare.<br>However, if one cares about availability in those rare cases, itâ€™s probably better to limit the number of partitions per broker to two to four thousand and the total number of partitions in the cluster to low tens of thousand.</p>
<h2 id="More-Partitions-May-Increase-End-to-end-Latency"><a href="#More-Partitions-May-Increase-End-to-end-Latency" class="headerlink" title="More Partitions May Increase End-to-end Latency"></a>More Partitions May Increase End-to-end Latency</h2><p>The end-to-end latency in Kafka is defined by the time from when a message is published by the producer to when the message is read by the consumer.<br>Kafka only exposes a message to a consumer after it has been committed, i.e., when the message is replicated to all the in-sync replicas.<br>So, the time to commit a message can be a significant portion of the end-to-end latency.<br>By default, a Kafka broker only uses a single thread to replicate data from another broker, for all partitions that share replicas between the two brokers.<br>Our experiments show that replicating 1000 partitions from one broker to another can add about 20 ms latency, which implies that the end-to-end latency is at least 20 ms.<br>This can be too high for some real-time applications.</p>
<p>Note that this issue is alleviated on a larger cluster.<br>For example, suppose that there are 1000 partition leaders on a broker and there are 10 other brokers in the same Kafka cluster.<br>Each of the remaining 10 brokers only needs to fetch 100 partitions from the first broker on average.<br>Therefore, the added latency due to committing a message will be just a few ms, instead of tens of ms.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, if you care about latency, itâ€™s probably a good idea to limit the number of partitions per broker to 100 x b x r, where b is the number of brokers in a Kafka cluster and r is the replication factor.</p>
<h2 id="More-Partitions-May-Require-More-Memory-In-the-Client"><a href="#More-Partitions-May-Require-More-Memory-In-the-Client" class="headerlink" title="More Partitions May Require More Memory In the Client"></a>More Partitions May Require More Memory In the Client</h2><p>In the most recent 0.8.2 release which we ship with the Confluent Platform 1.0, we have developed a more efficient Java producer.<br>One of the nice features of the new producer is that it allows users to set an upper bound on the amount of memory used for buffering incoming messages.<br>Internally, the producer buffers messages per partition.<br>After enough data has been accumulated or enough time has passed, the accumulated messages are removed from the buffer and sent to the broker.</p>
<p>If one increases the number of partitions, message will be accumulated in more partitions in the producer.<br>The aggregate amount of memory used may now exceed the configured memory limit.<br>When this happens, the producer has to either block or drop any new message, neither of which is ideal.<br>To prevent this from happening, one will need to reconfigure the producer with a larger memory size.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, to achieve good throughput, one should allocate at least a few tens of KB per partition being produced in the producer and adjust the total amount of memory if the number of partitions increases significantly.</p>
<p>A similar issue exists in the consumer as well.<br>The consumer fetches a batch of messages per partition.<br>The more partitions that a consumer consumes, the more memory it needs.<br>However, this is typically only an issue for consumers that are not real time.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>In general, more partitions in a Kafka cluster leads to higher throughput.<br>However, one does have to be aware of the potential impact of having too many partitions in total or per broker on things like availability and latency.<br>In the future, we do plan to improve some of those limitations to make Kafka more scalable in terms of the number of partitions.</p>
